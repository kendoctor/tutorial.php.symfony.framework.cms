#Familiar with symfony MVC

I think you know what's the meaning of MVC which is a well-known term.

1. M - model
2. V - view
3. C - controller

All these three stuffs we will meet with in symfony framework.

In traditional php development, a page means a .php file. But, in symfony, it seems a bit different.

How can we create a page in symfony?

Because this default symfony project contains lots of files and directory. For you as a newbie, at a first glance, you will be lost.

So let us have a brief idea about symfony project structure.

##Symfony project structure

In the root directory of the project. there are several files.

* composer.json - it's for composer to manage dependencies.
* composer.lock - generated by composer to lock current state.
* README.md - as the name is.
* LICENSE - as the name is.

There are several folders in the root.

* app - contains configuation,console,cache,logs etc.
* web - public folder for web site contains assetics and entry php scripts.
* src - user source codes will be put into this folder
* bin - some thirty-party binary could be put into this folder
* vendor - contains thirty-party php libraires and bundles.

Let us briefly check app folder

* AppCache.php - it's for cache usage. Default is not used.
* bootstrap.php.cache - for symfony application bootstrap.
* config [folder] - as the name is, contains various configs.
* phpunit.xml.dist - have you any idea about phpunit testing?
* AppKernel.php - Kernel of app, as the name states, it's important. As app begins to run, kernel will load bundles here.
* cache [folder] - the name you can see right? needs write permission for web server.
* console - executes symfony CLI cmds.
* Resources - yeah, app level resources for symfony app.
* autoload.php - including this file to autload namespaces and classes 
* check.php - check whether your current php env are fully fit for symfony framework or not.
* logs - yes. logs something for your diagnosis. nees write permission for web server.
* SymfonyRequirements.php - You should not change it. but, you can view it.
