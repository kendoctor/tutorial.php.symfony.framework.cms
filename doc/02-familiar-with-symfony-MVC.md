#Familiar with symfony MVC

I think you know what's the meaning of MVC which is a well-known term.

1. M - model
2. V - view
3. C - controller

All these three stuffs we will meet with in symfony framework.

In traditional php development, a page means a .php file. But, in symfony, it seems a bit different.

How can we create a page in symfony?

Because this default symfony project contains lots of files and directory. For you as a newbie, at a first glance, you will be lost.

So let us have a brief idea about symfony project structure.

##Symfony project structure

In the root directory of the project. there are several files.

* composer.json - it's for composer to manage dependencies.
* composer.lock - generated by composer to lock current state.
* README.md - as the name is.
* LICENSE - as the name is.

There are several folders in the root.

* app - contains configuation,console,cache,logs etc.
* web - public folder for web site contains assetics and entry php scripts.
* src - user source codes will be put into this folder
* bin - some thirty-party binary could be put into this folder
* vendor - contains thirty-party php libraires and bundles.
